## The Challenge
For more informations about the challenge [Click here](react-challenge.md)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

To run the specs:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```


Enviroment variables setup:

```bash
cp .env.development .env.local
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Challenges
Code challenges for developers and designers.

We believe recruitment is the most critical part of an organization. People should experience some time working together before deciding on making it permanent.
This repo contains code challenges we'd like to see solved by people interested in working with us.

We tend not to place job ads, as we prefer references and proactive candidates. With this in mind, feel free to take a challenge and let us know you're working on it.
Mostly, we work with Ruby and Clojure, but also have some stuff in Node.js. Even if you don't have experience in these technologies, as long as you are willing to learn them and want to build great stuff for the web, we can probably be a good fit.

### How we work ##

* **People** - you know, the guys in the team(s). We're not afraid to ask for help and we're not afraid to express our opinions. We're here to help.eachother.

* **Culture** - Paulo, one of your future colleagues, wrote about it. [https://medium.com/we-are-swat/what-its-like-to-work-on-the-swat-team-30d3a081e116]

* **You** - by joining our team, feel free to question all the items below and propose new ideas on how we work. This is definitely not a static thing.

* **GitHub** - all our code is hosted here. We use Pull Requests and do code reviews for those. Everyone on the team reviews PRs. It's expected that you write quality code with automated tests. Once a PR is reviewed and accepted, the person who opened the PR should merge it and delete the branch.

* **Continuous Integration** - we use Semaphore for our CI needs. Everytime we push to a branch, our test suite runs on Semaphore.

* **Slack** - we mostly communicate asynchronously between the development team and with other teams. This is our chat tool. Abuse it.

* **Pivotal Tracker** - our products' backlog is managed in Pivotal Tracker. Once we estimate all known user-stories, the sprint backlog is automatically built. Each team member will select a user-story to work from that sprint backlog and will update the needed tasks' status. This way we keep focused until the end of the sprint.

* **Support tasks** - We are paranoid about providing top notch support to our customers. We have a dedicated customer support team working full-time communicating with clients. Our development team works very closely with the customer support team delivering happiness to our clients.
