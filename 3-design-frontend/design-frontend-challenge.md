# Design/Frontend Challenge

We want you to explore how can we interact with live previews.


## 1 The problem

We want to create an interaction transition between screens and be able to live update the Country and NIF (step 1), as well as the invoice "logo" color (step 2) represented by a green circle in the right side illustration.

## 2 Implementation

* You can see an interactive prototype of the design [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/10cda4f8-1943-47fc-663e-e81f82e34bc9-66fc/).
* The prototype has 2 view types, wich you can choose from the right sidebar:
    * Interactive: represented by a speech icon.
    * Specs: represented by a coding icon.
* When in Specs View, you can:
    * Click in any element to see some properties.
    * Download icons or imagens.
    * See fonts syzes and colors.

## 3 What we value

* Code organization
* Good documentation

## 4 How to submit your solution:
  Repository(https://github.com/mninaut/challenges)

* Create a public repository
  * Create a PR where we can see the code and comment
  * Use a branching structure that makes it easier for us to review your work
* Deploy your solution to github pages

Best of luck!
